This is the codes for experiments in the paper     
R. Liu, J. Song, Z. Huang and J. Pan, EQRC: An enhanced QR code-based secure e-coupon transaction framework, 
in: 15 ICC 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), IEEE, 2019, pp. 1â€“6.     
and the paper submitted to JCS.     

Only for academic research.

The folders 21, 25, 33 are the QR codes used in the experiments of QRFC.
The corresponding experiment code is in the folder EQRC, wrote in C#. 
The .ned, .xml nad .ini files are used to simulate the communication.

#### For the details, we refer to the papers.
